## Heuristic Evaluation – Swiggy and Zomato

1.A heuristic evaluation was conducted to compare the user experience (UX) of Swiggy and Zomato.

2.Both apps offer similar main features such as restaurant listings, food search, live order tracking, and online payments.

3.The evaluation was based on Nielsen’s usability heuristics.

4.Swiggy has a fast and clean interface, giving users smooth performance.

5.However, Swiggy often shows too many offers and pop-ups that distract users.

6.Zomato provides more restaurant information and detailed user reviews.

7.But Zomato’s interface is more complex to navigate and appears cluttered on smaller screens.

8.Overall, both apps are strong in usability but have small UX gaps that can be improved for a smoother user experience.
