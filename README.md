## Aim:

To Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App To pick a website and its feature which I will be recreating as a ui ux designer .


## Algorithm:

1.Select and Compare 2–3 Competitor Apps/Websites 

2.Perform Heuristic Evaluation 

3.Analyze and Document Findings

4.Propose and Apply Improvements

In this project, a heuristic evaluation was conducted to compare the user experience (UX) of two popular food delivery apps — Swiggy and Zomato. Both platforms offer similar core features such as restaurant listings, food search, live order tracking, and digital payment options. However, through evaluation based on Nielsen’s usability heuristics, several UX gaps were identified. Swiggy provides a fast and clean interface but sometimes overwhelms users with excessive offers and pop-ups. Zomato, on the other hand, offers better restaurant details and reviews but has more navigation complexity and cluttered visuals on smaller screens.

To address these issues, my redesigned website focuses on simplicity, clarity, and smoother navigation. Key improvements include a floating order tracker widget, a sticky navigation bar for quick access, clean layout with boxed food images, and a clear color hierarchy for visual balance. Accessibility enhancements like ARIA labels, simplified filters, and error feedback for invalid inputs are also added. The design reduces cognitive load by removing unnecessary ads and emphasizes faster search with keyboard shortcuts. Overall, the improved website delivers a more intuitive, distraction-free, and user-friendly food ordering experience compared to Swiggy and Zomato.



## Result:
The Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App is created and verified.
